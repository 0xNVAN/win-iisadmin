### [ENSURE HOST HEADERS ON ALL SITES]

Update all HTTP host headers as they may respond with server details

CVE-2000-0649 FIX - Microsoft IIS Internal IP Address Disclosure Vulnerability

1. Open CMD.exe as admin in IIS folder [C:\Windows\System32\inetsrv]
2. Type: appcmd.exe set config -section:system.webServer/serverRuntime /alternateHostName:”HOSTNAME”  /commit:apphost
3. Replace HOSTNAME internet facing DNS


#### Validation Testing on Android

1. Download Termux on Android GooglePlay: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux
2. Open terminal and install the latest wget package by executing: **pkg install wget**
3. Install the latest openssl pacakges by executing: **pkg install openssl**
4. To open a TLS session exexcute: **openssl s_client -connect HOSTNAME:443**
5. Create an image request using HTTP 1.0 by executing: GET /image HTTP/1.0
6. HTTP header should show location as **HOSTNAME** (rather than the IP address)
7. Optional: If testing various content files or locations, repeat steps 4-6 until satisfied


#### Validation Testing on from external

1. Go to SSL Labs Server Test: https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/index.html
2. Type in **HOSTNAME** and then Submit the request
3. Allow time for the scans and simulations to complete
4. Scroll down to **HTTP Requests**
5. Check Location and confirm **HOSTNAME** is being sent instead of IP address


### [TRANSPORT ENCRYPTION]

Update Windows IIS SCHANNEL and CIPHER SUITES to ensure secure encryption
